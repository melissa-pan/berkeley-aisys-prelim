### [Optional] Background & History
- **Useful background knowledge:**
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (LeCun et al., 1998)
  - ImageNet dataset and competition
  - GPU computing for deep learning
  - Backpropagation and gradient descent

#### **Pre-history and context:**
  - Computer vision was dominated by hand-engineered features
  - Neural networks were considered impractical for large-scale problems
  - Limited computational resources prevented training deep networks

I found this talk to be very insightful [https://youtu.be/Z7naK1uq1F8?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/Z7naK1uq1F8?feature=shared) Feifei's talk on the human story behind imagenet, & why she believed imagenet is needed.
- Vision is an important human capability, 40% of the human brain neuron is related to vision.
- Before imagenet, classification are done on 20+ labels. But human can recongize 30k categories by age six. Fitting model on 20 labels is foundamentally off from real human capability.
- Thus we need imagenet (millions of object), but, scaling human annotation is challenging (so true). 
- Imagenet became the benchmark (with competitions) in visions, which is what AlexNet participated in.
