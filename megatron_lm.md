## The Problem

### What problem does this paper solve?

The challenge of training very large transformer language models that exceed the memory capacity of individual GPUs, while maintaining computational efficiency and scaling performance:

- **Memory constraints**: Large transformer models (billions of parameters) cannot fit in single GPU memory
- **Training inefficiency**: Existing parallelization approaches (data parallelism, pipeline parallelism) have limitations for very large models
- **Scaling challenges**: Need for techniques that can efficiently utilize hundreds of GPUs while maintaining training stability
- **Implementation complexity**: Previous model parallelism approaches required significant infrastructure changes or new compilers

### Prior art and why they didn't work well:

Before Megatron-LM, scaling large models faced several limitations:
- **Data parallelism only**: Limited by batch size and synchronization overhead; doesn't solve memory constraints per GPU
- **Pipeline parallelism**: Introduces pipeline bubbles and complex scheduling; limited by sequential nature
- **Existing model parallelism**: Required specialized compilers, complex infrastructure changes, or was limited to specific layers
- **Memory optimization techniques**: Gradient checkpointing and other methods helped but weren't sufficient for billion-parameter models

## The Key Idea

A simple, efficient **intra-layer model parallelism** approach that enables training transformer models with billions of parameters by parallelizing within transformer layers themselves.

Key insights:
- **Intra-layer parallelism**: Split individual transformer components (self-attention, MLP) across multiple GPUs rather than splitting entire layers
- **Minimal communication**: Carefully designed to require only two all-reduce operations per transformer layer
- **Native PyTorch implementation**: No need for custom compilers or major infrastructure changes
- **Orthogonal to other techniques**: Can be combined with pipeline parallelism and data parallelism
- **Transformer-specific optimizations**: Leverages the mathematical structure of transformer layers for efficient splitting

Benefits:
- **Massive scale**: Enables training of models with billions of parameters
- **High efficiency**: Maintains 76% scaling efficiency across 512 GPUs
- **Implementation simplicity**: Requires only insertion of a few communication operations
- **Flexibility**: Works with existing training frameworks and can be combined with other parallelism techniques

## The Challenge

### What are the main challenges in solving this problem?

- **Memory distribution**: How to efficiently split transformer layers across GPUs while maintaining mathematical correctness
- **Communication efficiency**: Minimizing communication overhead while maintaining model accuracy
- **Load balancing**: Ensuring all GPUs are efficiently utilized throughout training
- **Numerical stability**: Maintaining training stability and convergence properties at massive scale
- **Implementation complexity**: Creating a solution that's practical and doesn't require major infrastructure overhaul
- **Scaling efficiency**: Achieving good performance scaling as the number of GPUs increases

## The Method

Each layer has heavy linear algebra:

Attention projections: 
$$
Q = XW_Q, K = XW_K, V= XW_V 
$$

Output projection: 
$$
O = A W_O
$$

Feed-forward: 
$$
X W_1 â†’ activation â†’ (XW_1)W_2
$$

These multiplications involve very large weight matrices (dimensions in the tens of thousands).

Key Observation:
- These matrices can be partitioned across GPUs along rows or columns.
- Each GPU stores only a slice of the matrix and performs its partial multiplication.
- Results are combined with all-reduce or all-gather operations.


For Attention
- Multi-head attention already has natural parallelism: each head is independent.
- Megatron partitions heads across GPUs, and only a small synchronization is needed after computing attention scores.


### Brief overview (detailed analysis in Section 2):

- **Intra-layer model parallel approach**: Split individual transformer layer components across multiple GPUs
- **Self-attention parallelization**: Partition attention heads across GPUs with minimal communication
- **MLP parallelization**: Split feed-forward networks using column and row parallelism techniques  
- **Communication optimization**: Strategic placement of all-reduce operations to minimize overhead
- **Gradient synchronization**: Careful handling of backward pass to ensure correct gradient computation
- **Integration with data parallelism**: Combine model and data parallelism for maximum scalability

## Strengths:
- **Massive scalability**: Enables training of models with billions of parameters that don't fit on single GPUs
- **High efficiency**: Achieves 76% scaling efficiency across 512 GPUs compared to strong single-GPU baseline
- **Implementation simplicity**: Requires minimal code changes, works with native PyTorch
- **Orthogonal design**: Can be combined with data parallelism and pipeline parallelism
- **Practical applicability**: No need for custom compilers or specialized hardware
- **Strong empirical results**: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks
- **Communication efficiency**: Only requires 2 all-reduce operations per transformer layer

## Method

### Intra-layer Model Parallelism Approach:

**Core Principle**: Instead of distributing entire layers across GPUs, split individual transformer layer components (self-attention, MLP) across multiple GPUs.

### Self-Attention Parallelization:

1. **Multi-Head Attention Splitting**:
   - Partition attention heads across GPUs
   - Each GPU computes a subset of attention heads independently
   - Concatenate results and apply output projection
   - Communication required only for final output projection

2. **Mathematical Framework**:
   ```
   For multi-head attention with h heads split across p GPUs:
   - Each GPU handles h/p attention heads
   - Local computation: Q_i, K_i, V_i for head subset i
   - All-reduce after concatenation for output projection
   ```

3. **Memory and Communication Trade-off**:
   - Reduces memory per GPU by factor of p for attention weights
   - Requires one all-reduce operation per attention layer
   - Communication volume scales with hidden dimension, not sequence length

### MLP Parallelization:

1. **Column Parallelism (First Linear Layer)**:
   - Split weight matrix W across columns
   - Each GPU computes partial matrix multiplication
   - No communication needed during forward pass
   - Gradient communication required during backward pass

2. **Row Parallelism (Second Linear Layer)**:
   - Split weight matrix across rows  
   - Requires all-reduce after computation
   - Balances communication across both MLP layers

3. **Implementation Details**:
   ```
   First MLP layer:  Y = X @ W (W split by columns)
   Second MLP layer: Z = Y @ V (V split by rows, requires all-reduce)
   ```

### Communication Optimization:

**Strategic All-Reduce Placement**:
- Only 2 all-reduce operations per transformer layer
- One after self-attention output projection
- One after second MLP layer
- Overlapping communication with computation where possible

## Model Parallelism Principles

### Data Parallelism
- Same model put across GPUs,
- Different batches of data feed into the GPUs
- AllReduce of weight gradients after every iteration
- Works well until after GPT2 - model size limited by device memory
    - Cannot be used in isolation for large models
- Parallelism limited by batch size


### Model Parallelism: Overview
1. **Intra-layer vs Inter-layer Parallelism**:
   - **Inter-layer**: Different layers on different GPUs (pipeline parallelism)
   - **Intra-layer**: Split individual layers across multiple GPUs (Megatron approach)
   - **Trade-offs**: Memory distribution, communication patterns, load balancing
   - **Optimal choice**: Depends on model architecture, hardware topology, problem size

2. **Communication Patterns in Distributed Training**:

   - **Parameter distribution**: How to split model weights across devices
   - **Activation distribution**: Managing intermediate computation results
   - **Gradient distribution**: Synchronizing learning updates across devices
   - **Optimizer state distribution**: Managing Adam/other optimizer internal state

### Tensor Parallelism
- Take individual layer of tensor and shard across device
    - Split column-wise
- Replicate input across devices
- Forward pass - until `Dropout`, g -> AllReduce(Y1B1 + Y2B2), then drop out
- con: much more communication intensiven

### Pipeline Parallelism
- Each GPU has some copies of the model split by layer
- Microbatches 
- Con: pipeline bubble exists
```
bubble overhead = bubble time / ideal time = (p-1) / m
```
p = number of pipeline
m = number of microbatches

- but can interleave the forward pass and backward pass schedules to reduce bubble
